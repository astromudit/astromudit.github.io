I am mainly interesting in using detection of Gravitational Waves to learn something about their astrophysical environment. I mainly focus on GW waveform from the merger of massive black hole binaries embedded in an accretion disc. My recent project are:

* Evolution of LISA detectable intermediate mass black hole binaries in a thin gas disc<br>

* Signature of the fluctuating torque due to gas on the GW waveform of supermassive black hole binary merger <br>
