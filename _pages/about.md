I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of University of Maryland, College Park.

My current research interests include natural language generation, interactions between language and vision for learning, physics-informed machine learning, and domain adaptation. The application could be assisting content creation, as well as for social good.

I graduated from Columbia University with M.S. in Computer Science, and Sun Yat-Sen University with B.S. in Computational Mathematics. Before joining UMD, I worked on low resource cross-lingual information retrieval, information extraction and computer vision.

Outside research, I am an amateur artist in oil painting.
