I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of University of Maryland, College Park, where I'm working with Prof. Hal Daum√© III.

My research interests include natural language generation, language learning through visual and social interactions.

I graduated from Columbia University with M.S. in Computer Science, and Sun Yat-Sen University with B.S. in Computational Mathematics. Before joining UMD, I worked on low resource cross-lingual information retrieval, information extraction and computer vision.

Outside research, I am an amateur artist in oil painting.
