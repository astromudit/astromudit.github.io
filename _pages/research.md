I am mainly interesting in using detection of Gravitational Waves to learn something about their astrophysical environment. Apart from Lucio, I also collaborate with <a href="https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~aderdz/">Andrea Derdzinski</a>, <a href="https://lorenzzwick96.github.io/">Lorenz Zwick</a>, and <a href="https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~pcapelo/">Pedro R. Capelo</a>. My recent project are:

* Evolution of intermediate mass black hole binaries in a thin gas disc<br>

* Signature of the fluctuating torque due to gas on the GW waveform<br>
