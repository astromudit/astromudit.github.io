In my ongoing PhD, I am mainly interesting in using detection of Gravitational Waves to learn something about their astrophysical environment.My recent project are:

* Evolution of intermediate mass black hole binaries in a thin gas disc
* Signature of fluctuating torque due to gas on the GW waveform
