<i>The first detection of gravitational waves was equivalent to measuring the distance to the nearest star with an accuracy of the width of a human hair.</i>

Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is an ESA-NASA project to be launched in the orbit of the Sun following Earth 2030s. It builds upon the amazing success of ground based GWs detectors, collectively knowns as <a href=https://www.ligo.org/>LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration</a>. While LVK detectors are sensitive to up to ~200 MSun compact object (black holes mergers wit  mainly interesting in using detection of Gravitational Waves to learn something about their astrophysical environment. I mainly focus on GW waveform from the merger of massive black hole binaries embedded in an accretion disc. My recent project are:

* Evolution of LISA detectable intermediate mass black hole binaries in a thin gas disc<br>

* Signature of the fluctuating torque due to gas on the GW waveform of supermassive black hole binary merger <br>
