Welcome to my personal website :)

I am a final-year PhD student doing Gravitational Wave Astrophysics under the supervision of <a href = "https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Lucio-Mayer.html"  target="_blank">Prof. Lucio Mayer</a> at the University of Zurich. I am mainly interested in using GWs from inspiraling massive black hole binaries to not only probe source properties but also constrain their environment, especially in the context of the future space-based GWs detection mission <a href= "https://www.elisascience.org/" target="_blank">LISA</a>, adopted by ESA and supported by NASA in 2024.
