Welcome to my personal website :)

I am a second year PhD student under the supervision of <a href = "https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Lucio-Mayer.html">Prof. Lucio Mayer</a> at the University of Zurich. I am interested in Gravitational Waves (GWs) Astrophysics, especially in the context of the future space based GWs detection mission <a href= "https://www.elisascience.org/">LISA</a>.
