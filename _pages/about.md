I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of University of Maryland, College Park.

My research interest lies in the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning. More specifically, my goal is to develop machine learning models to understand and communicate with human language better. I am also interested in leveraging NLP for social good. 

I graduated from Columbia University with M.S. in Computer Science, and Sun Yat-sen University with B.S. in Computational Mathematics. Before joining UMD, I worked on low resource cross-lingual information retrieval and information extraction.

Outside research, I am an amateur artist in oil painting.
