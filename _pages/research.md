<i>In the past, we could only see the Universe, but now we can also hear it.</i>-Anonymous

<p align="justify">This quote beautifully illustrates that until the first direct observation of gravitational waves (GWs) by the ground-based detector <a href="https://www.ligo.org/" target="_blank">LIGO</a> in 2015, we only relied on electromagnetic signals (mainly via photons) to study the Universe. Now, we have this amazing tool to probe the Universe and unlock its mysteries, and because observed GWs have a characteristic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw" target="_blank"> frequency chirp</a>, in a way, we can listen to the Universe.</p>

<p align="justify">I am mainly interested in using the observation of GWs to learn about the source properties together with their astrophysical environment. I mostly focus on coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), formed via galaxy mergers, embedded in a gaseous accretion disc. To this aim, I use analytical and numerical techniques to perform source as well as waveform modeling. My recent projects are:</p>
