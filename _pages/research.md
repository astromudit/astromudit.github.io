<i>In the past, we could only see the Universe (via photons), but now we can also hear it (via gravitational waves).</i>-Anonymous

This quote alludes to the fact that the most observable gravitational waves (GWs) have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw"> frequency chirp</a>.

<i>Detecting gravitational waves is similar to measuring the distance to the nearest star with an accuracy of the width of a human hair.</i>-Anonymous

The above quote truly captures the challenge of directly observing gravitational waves (GWs), whose existence was suggested by Albert Einstein himself in 1916. While in principle, GWs are produced by any gravitational phenomena, we are only capable of detecting them from the most violent astrophysical events in the Universe. The primary source is the close interaction and possible merger of compact objects, namely White Dwarf (WD), Neutron Star (NS), and Black hole (BH). Only in 2015, we bacame capable enough to directly observe them using the ground based detector <a href="https://www.ligo.org/">LIGO</a>.  directly using the  Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is an ESA-NASA project to be launched in the orbit of the Sun following Earth 2030s. I am mainly interesting in using detection of Gravitational Waves to learn something about their astrophysical environment. I mainly focus on GW waveform from the merger of massive black hole binaries embedded in an accretion disc. My recent project are:

* Evolution of LISA detectable intermediate mass black hole binaries in a thin gas disc<br>
